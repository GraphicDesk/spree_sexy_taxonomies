SpreeSexyTaxonomies
===================

`spree_sexy_taxonomies` is intended to expand upon the possibilities for the display and presentation of 
taxonomies and taxons. At this point, it adds a "header" image to the Spree::Taxon model and displays it 
on the taxons#show page along with its previously existing "description" attribute.
